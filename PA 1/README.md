# Task 1: `Selection`

Write a program to determine (select) the `k`-th largest value in a list of `N` values.

## Requirements

**Files**
```
selection.cpp
selection.h
selection_tests.cpp
```

**Function**
```cpp
int select(size_t k, const int* list, size_t N);

Input
k       := the rank of the desired value, 0 < k <= N
list    := the collection of values from which to select
N       := the number of values in the list, N > 0

Output
The value which is the k-th largest in the list.

Exceptions
Throws std::invalid_argument if the arguments are
invalid, e.g. k is out of bounds.
```

**Approved Includes**
```cpp
cstddef, iostream, stdexcept, selection.h
```

**Tests**  
You must submit a test suite that, when run, covers at least 90% of your code.  
See How To Measure Coverage with Gcov

## Examples

Consider the list `A=[8,6,7,5,3,0,9]`.

```cpp
select(2, A, 7) # returns 8
select(4, A, 7) # returns 6
select(3, A, 7) # returns 7
select(5, A, 7) # returns 5
select(6, A, 7) # returns 3
select(7, A, 7) # returns 0
select(1, A, 7) # returns 9
select(0, A, 7) # throws std::invavlid_argument
select(8, A, 7) # throws std::invavlid_argument
```

# Task 2: `Collection<T>`

Write a class template,Collection, that stores an unordered collection of Objects

## Requirements

**Files**
```
collection.h
collection_tests.cpp
```

**Class template**
```
<typename Object>
class Collection;
```

**Member Functions**
```cpp
Collection();
# The default constructor makes an empty Collection.

----------------------

Collection(const Collection&);
~Collection();
Collection& operator=(const Collection&);
# The Rule of Three copies and destroys Collections.

----------------------

size_t size() const;
Input
None.

Output
The number of elements in the collection.

Exceptions
None.

----------------------

bool is_empty() const;
Input
None.

Output
Boolean true if and only if the collection is empty.

Exceptions
None.

----------------------

void make_empty();

Input
None.

Output
None.
Side effect: the collection is now empty.

Exceptions
None.

----------------------

void insert(const Object& obj);

Input
obj := the value to insert

Output
None.
Side effect: the collection now contains the value of obj.

Exceptions
None.

----------------------

void remove(const Object& obj);
Input
obj := the value to remove

Output
None.
Side effect: at most one element which has the same value as obj is  removed.

Exceptions
None.

----------------------

bool contains(const Object& obj) const;

Input
obj := the value to look for

Output
Boolean true if and only if an Object that is equal to obj is present in the collection.

Exceptions
None.
```
**Approved Includes**
```cpp
cstddef, iostream, stdexcept, collection.h
```

**Tests**  
You must submit a test suite that, when run, covers at least 90% of your code.  
See [How To Measure Coverage with Gcov](#how-to-measure-coverage-with-gcov)

## Examples

Consider the following sequence of operations with post conditions:
1. Make a new collection of ints: `Collection<int> the_collection`;
   1. A variable of type `Collection<int>` exists.
   2. The collection is empty.
2. Insert `8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9`: `the_collection.insert(8);` ...
   1. The collection has 7 elements: `{8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9}`
   2. The elements are the digits of Jennyâ€™s phone number
3. Remove `8`: `the_collection.remove(8)`;
   1. The collection has 6 elements: `{6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9}`
   2. The collection is not empty
4. Make empty: `the_collection.make_empty();`
   1. The collection is empty


# How To Measure Coverage with Gcov

## Compile with coverage
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -g --coverage <source files>
```

## Run
```bash
./a.out
```

## Generate coverage report
```bash
gcov -mr <source file>
```

## View coverage report
```bash
cat <source file>.gcov

'-' means the line is not executable (does not count for coverage)
'#####' means the line is executable but was executed 0 times
'126' means the line was executed 126 times
```

## Identify lines which are not covered

```bash
grep "#####" <source file>.gcov
```

## Clean up before next measurement
```bash
rm -f *.gcov *.gcno *.gcda
```


## Example
```bash
$ rm -f *.gcov *.gcno *.gcda
$ g++ -std=c++17 -g --coverage selection.cpp selection_tests.cpp
$ ./a.out
passed 56 / 56
ALL TESTS PASSING

$ gcov -mr selection.cpp
File 'selection.cpp'
Lines executed:97.83% of 46
Creating 'selection.cpp.gcov'

$ grep "#####" selection.cpp.gcov
    #####: 42: throw "whoop"; // this line is not covered

$ cat selection.cpp.gcov
    -: 0:Source:selection.cpp
    -: 0:Graph:selection.gcno
    -: 0:Data:selection.gcda
    -: 0:Runs:
... [snip] ...
  126: 41:if (k == 2007) {
#####: 42: throw "whoop"; // this line is not covered
    -: 43:}
... [snip] ...
```
